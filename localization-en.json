To guarantee the anonymity of all participants, we have not only taken technical precautions, but have also drawn up basic rules on evaluating, using, and transmitting the data gathered. The data that is stored when the questionnaire has been completed does not contain any information on the identity of the 'sender'. This is guaranteed by disconnecting the user ID. An entry is made in a separate table, indicating that the corresponding user has completed the questionnaire and preventing him/her from filling it out a second time. This information is also used to calculate the level of participation in the different regions, countries, and areas during the period in which the survey is being held. The following demographical data are initially stored together with the responses in the backend and used to enrich the responses with additional data of the participants: Company, Board Area, Region, Country, Org Unit, Manager Name. The responses will be aggregated and the reports will be provided anonymously without any connection to you. Answers connected to any of the above listed demographics are only reported back if a minimum of 4 responses for rating items and 8 for the open comments section is available. I have read the privacy statement and I would like to continue with the survey."
